Simple about me:
<div class="personal-info">
        <p id="important-font">Hi, I'm Chelsea.</p>

        <p>I like to work on creative, smart projects; learn alongside skilled collaborators; and impact my communities positively.</p>
        <p>I also like to illustrate, ride my bike, and read science-fiction.</p>
