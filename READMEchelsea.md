# Project Name

This is my personal website. It contains (or will soon) all my relevant professional information I'd like to highlight for my job search as a developer.

## Installation

Tools needed: screen, working eyes (or screenreader!), internet, fingers?

## Usage

There are no special usage instructions for my [personal website](narriteration.github.io) at this time. Have fun!

2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
